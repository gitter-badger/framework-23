                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Modules are not a new concept in the development world, nor they re new
to the PHP frameworks/applications. The implementation used here is not
too different from what has already been implemented in other frameworks
but the intent is clear and is aimed at enforcing the separation of
applications in logical parts, rather than having module provide
helper functionality (although they can also be used in that way, but
might fee less intuitive)</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>A module must be as self-contained as possible. It is up to the module
developer to determine what configuration is comming from where, but
mandatory (such as internal dependency mapping) should be defined and
might even be appropriate to have it hardcoded, but optional things,
such as database connection settings, etc. should be retrieved from the
main application container via an acceptable method explained inside
module's <code>readme</code> on <code>installation</code> files.</p>
<p>A module should have it's logic as self-contained as possible, except
for configurations, since that will change from application to
application.</p>
<p>The only requirement in order to ensure consistency (as of now it is not
enforced) is for the module to serve as a factory that MUST return
instance of <code>Application</code>, since application is a middleware it does not
introduce a very specific behaviour, except maybe for having a separate
middleware delegate defined and a separate router for the module itself.</p>
<p>Internally the <code>ModuleDelegateFactory</code> is building a router with every
instance <code>Application</code> assigned it's own prefix inside a <code>module</code> key.</p>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>The minimal configuration to the container is:</p>
<pre><code>return [
    // .. other configuration
    'middleware' =&gt; [
        'modules'
    ],
    'modules' =&gt; [
        '/path/prefix' =&gt; MyApp\API\Module::class
    ]
]
</code></pre>

<p>An example module class:</p>
<pre><code>namespace MyApp\API;

use Interop\Container\ContainerInterface;
use Onion\Framework\Application\Application;
use Onion\Framework\Application\Interfaces\ModuleInterface;

class Module implements ModuleInterface
{
    // Optional, but makes things clearer
    private function getConfigurations(): array
    {
        return [
            'routes' =&gt; [
                [
                    'pattern' =&gt; '/api/users',
                    'middleware' =&gt; [
                        UsersApiController::class
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ];
    }

    public function build(ContainerInterface $container): Application
    {
        return new Application
            // Retrieve everything from a contextual container
            $this-&gt;getOwnContainer()-&gt;get(\Interop\Middleware\DelegateInterface),
            $container-&gt;get(EmitterInterface::class)
        );
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is recommended for a module class to fetch the <code>EmitterInterface</code>
from the main container, instead of defining it's own since it will
avoid issues with custom emitter implementations if applicable. Also
note that the route must have the prefix defined by default in order to
avoid this duplication (if that is your thing, but do keep in mind that
the intent behind this kind of modules is that a module can and should
be able to function as it's own application and not only as a module of
another). Once the initial testing has been performed a CLI application
will be developed allowing for the generation of module classes from
existing applications, which will empower use-cases such as minimal blog
to be embedded inside another application at a prefix; as well as
install/uninstall steps, but that is TBD as of now so don't rely
completely on that, but do keep in mind that the reasoning behind the
modules is here to stay.</p>
<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
<p><em>Majority of the following points are intended to serve only as
guide lines, and developers are free to ignore them, but complying
will ensure consistency between module structure and workflow, hence
improving experience</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A module is a component of an application or website that provides visitor
 access to specific part of the website, a module should not only provide
 libraries and/or frameworks (for that part please stick with composer, see
 <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/02-libraries.md#publishing-to-a-vcs">composer documentation for information on how to use VCS for package distribution</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A module should provide contact information to allow users to report issues
 make/discuss feature requests and/or disclose security vulnerabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another highly recommended thing to do is follow the PHP standards (PSR) to
 ensure compatibility with other libraries/modules/frameworks, that the
 user might be using within their application, out of the box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following the HTTP standards is also a good thing to do, since that will
 increase the flexibility of user implementations in a magnitude. Example:
 if you provide <code>Last-Modified</code> header and check for <code>If-Modified-Since</code>
 the application may become more performant, since no data should be
 transfered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a developer you should try to keep the dependencies for your module
 as minimal as possible so users do not get bloated with dependencies,
 also as a added benefit you lower the risk of your module breaking, because
 of external changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A module, should not provide/enforce specific view components, since it
 may break application/website functionality/appearance, rather a API backend
 should be previded with information/tutorials/examples on how to communicate
 with said backend in a consistent way. *Design your modules for front ends
 built using modern frameworks like, ReactJS and Angular2 or other similar ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A module should be kept as small and self-contained as possible. For example
 if a module is intended to provide blogging functionality it should (where applicable)
 be split in separate compoenets for <code>posts</code>, <code>comments</code>, <code>editing</code>. That way users
 would have the opportunity to mix and match compoents that are compatible or directly
 write a custom one to fit their needs or bridge gaps between different modules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A module may communicate with existing services, but it is recommended to provide
 information with which services/3rd parties information is exchanged and for what
 purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A module should not intend to modify files inside or outside of itself, when such
 configuration is required it should provide detailed information what, where and why
 should be changed for the user to configure (or optionally a script can be provided,
 but not automatically executed)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optionally your module may provide a UI, but it should be implemented in such a way
 that it's styling should be easily changeable since, different people have different
 tastes.</p>
</li>
